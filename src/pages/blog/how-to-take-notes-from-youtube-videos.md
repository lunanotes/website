There are many different ways to take notes from a YouTube video. Some people use pen and paper, others use a computer, and some use a combination of the two. Regardless of your preferred method, there are some general guidelines that you can follow in order to get the most out of your note-taking experience.

### Watch the entire video first

Watch the video once through without taking any notes, this will help you get an idea of what the video is about and what information is covered, this will help us focus on only key points rather than trying to write down everything that happens in the video.

### Take screnshots

Another option is to take screenshot images of key moments in the video, which you can then organize into a more structured document once you have completed viewing the entire video. This method is ideal for visual learners who prefer not to rely on written notes alone.

For example, if you have a question about an equation, take a screenshot of it so that you can reference it later when taking notes. You can also take screenshots of images or graphs that would be helpful when making notes.

### Write down the key points in your own words

The key to taking better notes is writing your own words. It will help you remember the important points and phrases more easily, which means that when it comes time for review they won't be forgotten!

Be sure to include any resources or additional information that was mentioned in the video for your own research purposes!

### Review your notes after the video is finished

This will give you an opportunity to see if there are any gaps or areas that need improvement in your understanding of the subject matter. You should also check over your notes by looking at them from multiple angles (e.g., read them out loud).

## Conclusion

Using all of these methods together can help ensure that your notes from a YouTube video are both comprehensive and effective. I don't think there's really one "right" way to take notes from a YouTube video or any other video for that matter. It's all about what works best for you and how you learn best.
