It’s the perfect way to take notes while watching lectures or tutorials on YouTube without having to switch back and forth between your browser and a blank notebook. Pretty handy, right?

Here’s how you can use LunaNotes to ace your classes.

## Why LunaNotes is Awesome for Students

It's no secret that we learn differently. Some of us are visual learners, some auditory, and some kinesthetic. And while there are advantages and disadvantages to each learning style, one constant is this: taking notes helps us retain information. No matter how you learn best, if you want to remember what you've studied, writing it down (or typing it out) is always a good idea.

But what happens when your lectures or TED talks are coming at you from a screen? How do you take advantage of the benefits of note taking when you're watching a video?

Here are a few tips on how to make the most out of LunaNotes for your schoolwork:

1. **Taking Notes in Class**: If you're watching a lecture on YouTube, simply click the "Add Note" button at the bottom of the screen and start typing away! You can tag specific timing in the video by clicking the "Add Timestamp" button next to "Add Note." That way, you can quickly find parts of the video that you want to review later. When you're done with your notes, click the "Save" button and they'll be safely stored in your Library.

2. **Organizing Your Notes**: You can tag your notes with keywords (e.g. #biology) by clicking on the hashtags icon next to the "Save" button. That way, you can easily search for specific topics later. For example, let's say you have 20 different biology lectures saved in your Library—you can quickly find all of your notes on cell division by searching for the "#biology" tag.

3. **Annotating Screenshots**: Sometimes it's helpful to take a screenshot of something in the video that you want to remember later. With LunaNotes, you can do that with just a couple clicks! Click on the "Screenshot" button at the bottom of the screen, and then draw or type directly on the screenshot before saving it in your library. You can also add tags (e.g. #diagram) so that you can easily search for it later."
